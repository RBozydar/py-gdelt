Today we mark a truly transformative moment in the history of GDELT. From its public debut a year and a half ago, GDELT has grown at a rate that it is almost impossible to imagine, passing over [one million downloads](http://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-celebrates-1-million-downloads/) in six months this past August, and finding application across the globe. From its founding, the vision of the GDELT Project has lain not just in [codifying physical events](http://www.gdeltproject.org/#computing) from the world’s news media, nor just creating a [contextual graph](http://www.gdeltproject.org/#computing) over the people, organizations, locations, and themes of the media, but to move beyond these towards quantifying the extraordinary array of latent emotional and thematic signals subconsciously encoded in the world’s media each day.

The GDELT Project’s full name stands for the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) and it is with incredible excitement that today we have the pleasure of officially unveiling to you the first glimpses of those Language and Tone portions of the GDELT Project initiative: the Global Content Analysis Measures (GCAM), to be rolled out over the coming weeks. In a nutshell, the GCAM system runs each news article monitored by GDELT through an array of leading content analysis tools to capture over 2,230 latent dimensions, reporting density and value scores for each. Using GCAM, you can assess the density of “Anxiety” speech via Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), "Positivity"via Lexicoder, “Smugness” via WordNet Affect, “Passivity” via Regressive Imagery Dictionary, “Perception” via WordNet Lexical Categories, “Moral/Spiritual” via Forest Values, “Vanity” via Roget’s Thesaurus, “Goal” via General Inquirer, and the list goes on and on! In total, 18 content analysis systems totaling more than 2,230 dimensions are now run on each news article seen by GDELT each day and all of these scores will be available via the forthcoming daily [GKG 2.0](http://blog.gdeltproject.org/introducing-gkg-2-0-the-next-generation-of-the-gdelt-global-knowledge-graph/) updates. When GDELT transitions to 15 minute updates later this month, all of these dimensions will even be calculated across the world’s news monitored by GDELT in near-realtime! See the [GCAM Master Codebook](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GCAM-MASTER-CODEBOOK.TXT) for a list of all of the dimensions available and the[Global Knowledge Graph 2.0 Codebook](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Global_Knowledge_Graph_Codebook-V2.pdf) (scroll down to the GCAM field) for more details on the file format of the GCAM field and how to work with it.

We are incredibly excited to see what all of you are able to do with this incredible new chapter in GDELT’s history!

Below you’ll find the complete list of dictionaries currently used by the GCAM system to process each news article. If you've developed content analysis tools or dictionaries that you’d be willing to make available for us to run over the world’s news each day, we’d love to hear from you! We'll be making an announcement in the next two weeks when the new daily GKG 2.0 files with the GCAM encodings are available, so stay tuned!
