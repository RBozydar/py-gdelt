| Description | All public statements expressed verbally or in action not otherwise specified. This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 011 to 017 cannot be made. Note that statements are typically subordinate events; events such as comments are coded as mere statements only when they do not further imply appeals, agreements, support, apologies, demands, disapprovals, rejections, threats, etc. |
| Example     | U.S. military chief General Colin Powell said on Wednesday NATO would need to remain strong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Usage Notes  | This event form is a verbal act. The target for this event type is the party that introduces some accusation or charge against the source actor who denies responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Example      | The government of Liberia denied on Thursday charges by Ivory Coast that Monrovia is committing genocide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Example      | South Korea on Friday rejected as "totally baseless" accusations by Amnesty International that it had carried out mass arrests of political prisoners, but church human rights groups here supported the accusations.                                                                                                                          |
| NAME         | Engage in symbolic act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Description  | Engage in symbolic activities such as holding vigils, attending funerals, and laying wreath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Usage Notes  | Use this event form for all symbolic acts, including those that imply empathy. Use 018 to code only empathetic comments (i.e. not actions).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| NAME         | Make empathetic comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Description  | Express empathy, condolences, sympathy, understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Usage Notes  | This event form refers exclusively to verbal acts or comments. Empathetic and other symbolic actions should be coded as 017 instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Example      | Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Saturday expressed condolences to the United States for the death of three American diplomats.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| NAME         | Express accord                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Description  | Express common understanding, agreement, or accord.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Usage Notes  | This event form refers exclusively to verbal acts or comments. Use this code when actors indicate that they simply agree or concur on an issue but do not imply commitment or intent to cooperate on that issue. These are typically reciprocal events (see example below) and require coding of more than one 019 event with actors reversed. |
| Example      | President Reagan and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak agreed today there was an urgent need for progress towards a Middle East settlement and that a freeze on Israeli settlements in occupied territories was also needed.                                                                                                                    |
| Example Note | Two reciprocal events (both 019) are coded with actors reversed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description | All requests, proposals, suggestions and appeals not otherwise specified. This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Usage Notes | through 028 cannot be made. Events coded under this category refer to pleas made either on the source actor's own behalf or on behalf of another party (i.e. the source asks that the target does something either for self or for a third party). Note that this and all the subcategories are distinct from demands, which are more forceful, and from pledges, which imply commitments, agreements, or promises on the part of the source actor. |
| NAME        | Appeal for material cooperation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Description | Make an appeal for, request, or suggest material cooperation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Usage Notes | This event form is typically, though not exclusively, a verbal act. It refers to appeals for material cooperation specifically; appeals for diplomatic cooperation, such as for the provision of support on a particular policy, are coded as 022 instead. (Note that the actual events of material cooperation are coded under category 06.)                                                                                                       |

| Usage Notes | Use this code for requests to develop or expand trade and other forms of economic exchange. Appeals for provision of economic aid-not mutual exchangeare coded as 0231 instead.

| Description | Make an appeal for, request, or suggest initiating or expanding cooperation in judicial matters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Usage Notes | Use this code for requests to develop or expand cooperation in such matters as extraditions. Appeals for information or other investigative tools, even if to be used in courts of law, are coded as 0214 instead. Note that in case of extraditions, the target for this event type is not the subject but the country he would be extradited to. Actual events of judicial cooperation are coded as 063. |
| Example     | Turkey renewed an appeal to Belgium to extradite a far-left militant wanted for murder, Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Thursday, slamming what he called lax international cooperation against terrorism.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Usage Notes  | This category contains sub-forms for more detailed coding whenever possible. The source could be requesting aid for itself or on behalf of a third party; in either case, the actor whom the request is directed to should be coded as the target. Note that only requests for or suggestions of material aid are coded under this category; events coded under 023 imply neither the receipt or delivery of material aid nor a commitment on the part of the source actor to provide such aid. For the latter two cases, refer instead to categories 07 and 033, respectively. |

| Description | Make an appeal for, request, or suggest political change not otherwise specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Usage Notes | This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More force-ful "demands" for political change are coded under 104; expressions that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14. Source actors can be local citizens as well as international actors; they could be making the appeal on their own behalf or on behalf of others. Note that when the requested reform clearly constitutes some form of concession or yielding by the target such as the easing of administrative sanctions, a more appropriate 'Appeal' code might be found under 025. |
| Example     | About 300 representatives from Egyptian civil society organizations submitted the most recent in a series of reform petitions, under the title "In Defense of the Nation" to the Saudi royal family. European ministers had called for Burma to institute reforms before joining the ASEAN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Usage Notes | This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful "demands" for leadership change are coded as 1041; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding change in leadership/power are coded under category 14. Note that even though calls for the target to resign or relinquish power are forms of yielding, they are still coded here. Also code appeals for elections here.                                                                                                                     |
| Example     | Members of parliament from Kenya's Liberal Democratic Party called on Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi to resign in the wake of new evidence over the $7 billion scandals.

| Description | Make an appeal for, request, or suggest change in any particular policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Usage Notes | This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful "demands" for policy change are coded as 1042; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding change in leadership/power are coded under category 14. Just like the source actor, the policy in question can also be domestic or international in nature. If it is clear from the lead that by requesting certain policy changes the source is in fact appealing to the target to yield or concede, the event might be better coded under 035. |
| Example     | U.S. President George W. Bush said Friday that he will tell Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that Japan needs to enact significant economic reforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Usage Notes | This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. More forceful "demands" for institutional change are coded as 1044; demonstrations, protests, etc. demanding such change are coded under category 14. Institutional change is different from policy change in that the former directly alters the rules of the game. Requests for fundamental changes in the political system (e.g. democratization) as well as for more limited institutional changes (e.g. changing electoral law) are coded here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Usage Notes  | This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source for this event type may or may not be one of the adversaries; a third party could also be appealing to one or more of the parties in conflict (who are coded as targets) to yield. When the source itself expresses its intent to yield-rather than requesting it from another party-the event should be coded under 035 instead. When yielding actually takes place, use the appropriate code under category 08. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wants Germany to pay more compensation to the families of 11 Israeli athletes killed at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, a statement from his office said Tuesday. |

| Example      | The United States called on Israel to move forward with its "courageous and historic" disengagement plan as fast as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Example Note | While "disengagement" does not necessarily involve any kind of release of persons or property, in the case of Israel we can safely assume that any mention of the "disengagement plan" refers primarily to the withdrawal of settlements, hence, the return of land to the Palestinians; phrases involving "disengagement" or "settlements" can be entered into verb dictionaries, particularly the Middle East dictionary, as the appropriate codes pertaining to the release of property. |

| Example      | An international aid agency appealed to the Sudanese government on Friday to urgently reconsider its ban on relief flights to southern Sudan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Description | Make an appeal for, request, or suggest that target stops fig ting or takes measures to ease military conflict or tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Usage Notes | Use this code for appeals for ceasefires, military withdrawals, and demobilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Example     | The presidents of Iraq and Egypt called on Tuesday for the withdrawa l of Syrian and other foreign forces from Lebanon to end 14 years of civil war there. Because of the compound source (governments of Iraq and Egypt), two events are coded. Leaders of the 16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) called on Wednesday for an immediate ceasefire in war-torn Liberia.                                                                                                                                    |

| Description | Propose or suggest meeting, negotiation, or discussion among other parties. This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source for this event cannot be the actors whose meeting or negotiation is called for ; it has to be third parties who appeal to one or more actors- target actors-to meet and/or negotiate. When parties themselves express their intent to meet and/or negotiate, use 036 instead. When meetings or negotiations do take place, use the appropriate code under category 04. |
| Example     | El Salvador on Monday requested an urgent Security Council meeting on Wednesday to deal with what it called violations by Nicaragua of the Central American peace accords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Description | Propose or suggest that others reach a settlement, agreement, or resolution of conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Usage Notes | This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Note that the source for this event cannot be the adversaries themselves . When one or more parties to a conflict call for ending the conflict, that is taken to be an expression of intent on the part of that source actor to reach a settlement and is thus coded as 037 instead. The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said here Saturday that he urges                                                                                              |
| Example     | Iran and the EU trio (France, Germany, and Britain) to reach an agreement in their talks on Iran's nuclear program. Given the presence of four different targets, four events are coded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Description | Propose or suggest that target mediates or accepts the mediation of others. This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Note that the source for this event cannot be the potential mediator or parties to the conflict. When an actor proposes to play the role of mediator himself, this is assumed to be a commitment on his part and is coded as 039 instead. When one or more of the adversaries request that another party plays the role of a mediator, this is understood to be a commitment on their part to accept mediation and is thus coded as 038. The target can either be a potential mediator (whose mediation is being requested) or one of the adversaries (who is requested to allow involvement of mediators). The International Crisis Group has called on the UN stabilization mission in Haiti to broker an agreement among Haitians that "establishes common objectives for the next government." |       |

| Usage Notes | Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to deploy peacekeeping or other military forces for security. Source actor for this event is the party making the commitment to provide forces, while the target represents the prospective location of deployment. Actual deployments should be coded as linked events 'Provide military protection or peacekeeping' (074) and 'Receive deployment of peacekeepers' (0861) with actors reversed. Commitments by adversaries to accept peacekeepers should be coded as 0355. France is ready to contribute up to 4,000 troops to an international peace- keeping force in Yugoslavia, Defence Minister Pierre Joxe said on Monday.

| Description | Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to institute political change not otherwise specified. If the promised reforms clearly constitutes some form of concession or yielding by the source, such as the easing of existing administrative sanctions, a more appropriate code might be found under 035. If there are specific groups or individuals asking for that change and that information is codeable given the structure of the lead, those actors should be coded as targets; otherwise, the country in general or actors to be affected by the change should be coded as the target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Usage Notes  | Commitments to resign or hand over power, as well to hold elections that might open the way for change in leadership, are coded here. Note that while commitments for other forms of yielding are coded under 035, commitments to give up power are coded here. Ousted President Askar Akyev has agreed to resign without returning to the Kyrgyzstan, the Parliament speaker said Saturday. Because no specific group is mentioned, the country alone is coded as the target. |

| Usage Notes  | Use this code for commitments to bring policy change-political, economic, military, social, or otherwise. If the policy change in question clearly represents a form of yielding, the appropriate code under 035 should be used instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Example      | Planning and Investment Minister Tran Xuan Gia said Vietnam is committed to opening up the economy but will not be rushed, in a rare interview late on Friday. Vietnam can be coded as the target since the country in general is obviously going to be affected from such a change in policy.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Description  | Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to provide social, political, economic, or other rights and freedoms. If it is clear from the lead that by promising to provide certain rights the source is in fact committing to yield, the event might be better coded under 035. Commitments to provide compensation for previously violated rights, for instance, are coded as 035.                                                             |
| Example      | Turkey will allow up to 13,000 Turkish Kurd refugees who have lived in Iraq for more than a decade to return home as part of a UN-brokered deal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Example Note | Allowing the voluntary repatriation of refugees constitutes provision of the right to go home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Example      | Ethopia has agreed to re-open its borders to UN peacekeepers, who are de- polyed in the region to oversee a ceasefire between Ethiopia and its neighbor, Eritrea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Example      | In a letter handed over to the United Nations on Monday, Iraq said it would allow the return of U.N. weapons inspectors "without conditions" to "remove any doubts Iraq still possesses weapons of mass destruction."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Example      | With the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Cessation of Hostilities, the Sudanese government and SPLM/A have agreed to allow "unimpeded humanitarian access to all areas and for people in need."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Example     | Yugoslavia and Slovenia agreed to a ceasefire after two days of fierce fighting but media reports said sporadic clashes were still continuing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example     | Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed. Shefket Musliu said on 21 May in Konculj, in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that his forces will lay down their weapons and disband by the end of the month because "the time has come. . . . to seek changes through political means," AP reported.                                                                                                                         |

| Description | Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to meet, visit, or engage in talks or negotiations. This event code refers to future commitments to meet and/or negotiate; when meetings, negotiations, or other talks do take place, those are coded under category 04 instead. When mediation is mentioned specifically, appropriate mediation-related codes take precedence over meetings or negotiations. |
| Usage Notes | appropriate mediation-related codes take precedence over meetings or negotiations. East German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer will visit Albania in June, the first Warsaw Pact foreign minister to do so since Tirana split with Moscow in 1961, the Albanian embassy said. Given the wording of this lead, which implies that Albania has already com-                                                                                |
| Example     | mitted to receive the German minister, two reciprocal events of 038 are coded with actors reversed. This example fits under this category since the future tense used implies a future commitment to meet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Example     | On September 29, Putin offered to negotiate with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov following the invasions of Dagestan. Unlike the previous example, this lead does not suggest that Maskhadov has also committed to meeting with Putin, hence only one 036 event is coded with the Russian government as the source actor.                                                                                                             |

When other parties make appeals to end disputes in which they are not directly involved, use 'Appeal to others to settle dispute' (027) instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Usage Notes | This code represents adversaries' commitments to receive mediation by third parties. The latter should be coded as targets, while the source has to be one or more of the parties in conflict for this event. Note that when reports involve references to mediation specifically, mediation-related codes such as this take precedence over others, such as 'Agree to meet or negotiate,' 'Make a visit,' 'Host a visit,' and 'Meet at a third location.' For commitments by third parties to mediate refer to code 039 instead. For simple suggestions by actors other than adversaries and potential mediators that mediation occurs, use 'Appeal to others to engage in or accept mediation' (028). |
| Example     | Afghan rebel leaders said on Wednesday they would meet U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez if he gave them a veto over any settlement reached in peace talks. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has agreed to US mediation in the final status talks with the Palestinians, a senior Israeli official said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Description  | Offer, promise, agree to, or otherwise indicate willingness or commitment to play the role of a mediator. This code represents a commitment by third parties to mediate between parties in conflict. The former should be coded as source and the later as targets for this event. Note that when reports involve references to mediation speci- cally, mediation-related codes such as this take precedence over others , such as 'Agree to meet or negotiate,' 'Make a visit,' 'Host a visit,' and 'Meet at a third location.' For commitments of adversaries to accept mediation by actors other than the adversaries and potential mediators that mediation occurs, refer to 'Appeal to others to engage in or accept mediation' (028). |
| Example      | Gambian President Dawda Jawara will visit Mauritania and Senegal to medi- ate in a border dispute between the two West African neighbors, diplomatic sources said on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Example Note | Given the wording used in this particular lead, which implies that Mauritania and Senegal have already agreed to Gambia's mediation, two types of linked events are coded- 'Express intent to mediate' (039) with the Gambian president as the source, and 'Express intent to accept mediation' (038) with Mauritania and Senegal as sources. Two different events are coded for each of these event types since Mauritania and Senegal are compound actors. King Hassan of Morocco was quoted today as saying he would be ready to host a meeting between an Israeli peace movement and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).                                                                                                       |
| Example Note | Unlike the previous example, this lead does not imply that either the Israeli or the Palestinian parties have accepted King Hassan's offer to mediate, hence no 'Agree to mediation' event is coded. Given the compound target, two separate 039 events are coded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Usage Notes | This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 041 through 046 cannot be made. Note that events coded under 04 are typically, although not always, reciprocal events.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Example     | A group of African diplomats held their first meeting with President Par- vanov at a lunch hosted by the Ambassador of Kingdom of Morocco. This lead is coded as 040 since the place of the meeting is not explicit in the lead, hence we cannot code it as a visit made or hosted, and no negotiations are implied (so, we cannot code it as 'Engage in negotiation'). |

| Description  | Travel to another location for a meeting or other event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Usage Notes  | All visits and travels should be coded under this category. Note that this event is typically accompanied by the linked event 'Host a visit' (043). If mediation or negotiation is mentioned specifically as having taken place, those events take precedence over unspecified visits or meetings. |
| Example      | Taiwan's Vice Foreign Minister visited Russia today, becoming the island's highest ranking government official to go there.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Example Note | Two events are coded: 042 with the Taiwanese government as the source and Russia as the target, and 043 with actors reversed.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Example Note | Iraqi President Saddam Hussein arrived in Amman on a previously unannounced visit on Wednesday. Two events are coded: 042 with the Iraqi government as the source and Jordan as the target, and 043 with actors reversed.                                                                          |

| Description  | Host or receive a visitor at residence, office or home country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Usage Notes  | This event is typically accompanied by the linked event 'Make a visit' (042). If mediation or negotiation is mentioned specifically as having taken place, those events take precedence over unspecified visits or meetings.                                                                       |
| Example      | Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday hosted Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in this Siberian city for an informal meeting aimed at establishing close personal relations between the two leaders.                                                                                 |
| Example Note | Two events are coded: 043 with the Russian government as the source and the Japanese government as the target, and 042 with the actors reversed.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Example      | President Francois Mitterand gave a warm welcome on Thursday to South African leader F.W. de Klerk who is attempting to break his country's international isolation.                                                                                                                               |

| Description  | Meet, come together, gather with others at a neutral location-some place with which none of the attending parties are associated. If mediation or negotiation is mentioned specifically as having taken place, those events take precedence over unspecified visits or meetings. This event type is typically accompanied by two other linked events, 'Make a visit' (042) and 'Host a visit' (043), and the event itself is reciprocal. For 044, the source and the target are the actors who are meeting; the location of the meeting is ignored.   |
| Example      | U.S. and Soviet negotiators return to Geneva this week for talk on limiting the number of European-based nuclear missiles, an issue likely to dominate East-West relations this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Example Note | Six events are coded: two reciprocal 'Meet at a third location' events with US and the Soviet Union as actors; two ''Make a visit' events with Switzerland as the target, and the US and the Soviet Union as the two different sources; and two 'Host a visit' events with Switzerland as the source and the US and the Soviet as the two different targets.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Usage Notes  | This event code should be used only when a party meets with others explicitly as a mediator. The source is always the mediator and adversaries are the targets. All other cases of meetings and negotiations, where the pur- pose of the meeting or the role of the source actor is not specified, should be coded elsewhere under category 04. If meetings, discussions, or negoti- tions are explicitly reported as involving mediators, the mediation code takes precedence as long as the party acting as the mediator is identified in the lead. |
| Example      | Arab League Secretary General Chadli Klibi undertook mediation mission between Syria and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Example Note | Because of the compound target actor, two events are coded.

| Description  | Negotiate or bargain with others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Usage Notes  | This event code should be used only when the report makes clear that negotiations, bargaining, or discussions are involved in the meetings or consultations in question. "Holding talks" and "discussions" are treated as negotiations. These are reciprocal events.                                                                |
| Example      | Israel and Lebanon renewed negotiations today on an Israeli troop pullback from Lebanon and their future relations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Example Note | Two 046 events are coded with actors reversed. French National Assembly president Laurent Fabius and a group of deputies held talks with leaders of Romania's new government on Tuesday, the first high level Western delegation to visit Bucharest since last month's revolu- tion. Two 046 events are coded with actors reversed. |

| Usage Notes  | This event form is a verbal act. Use this code only for political, diplomatic, and non-material defense; military cooperation or defense should be coded elsewhere.                                                                                                                |
| Example      | The United States on Thursday defended the right of Soviet troops to fire protectively on militants in Azerbaijan and insisted unrest there reflected age-old ethnic tensions, not a fight for political independence.                                                             |
| Example      | Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat defended Iraq and Libya on Friday against Western criticism of their arms industries and said the West was applying double standards on human rights. Because of the compound target, two events are coded.                                       |

| Usage Notes  | This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Use this event form to code instances where one party (the source) solicits the support of third parties for another party (the target).                                                                     |
| Example      | Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi today urged the European Community to support the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), which he said would create a favorable climate for peace talks.                                                                            |
| Example      | Saudi Arabia has mobilized pressure groups in the United States to help support the rights of Palestinians in their struggle against Israel, a top minister said in comments published Thursday.                                                                                   |

| Description  | Grant diplomatic recognition, initiate diplomatic relations with a state or a                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Usage Notes  | This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. Recognition of newly independent states, new governments that might have come to power through unconventional means, and initiation of diplomatic ties with an entity for the first time are all coded here. |
| Example      | Sri Lanka has established diplomatic ties with and opened an embassy in Tehran, the foreign ministry said on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                            |

| Description  | Express regret or remorse for an action or situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Usage Notes  | Although this event form is typically a verbal act, it should also be used to code all nonverbal acts that express remorse.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Example      | Argentina has apologized to Brazil for one of its gunboats intercepting a Brazilian ship in the Beagle Channel, disputed by Argentina and Chile.                                                                                                                                   |

| Usage Notes  | Use this event form to code verbal and nonverbal gestures of forgiveness and explicitly conciliatory actions or announcements. Formal pardons and amnesties of arrested persons, as well as the release or exchange of prisoners, should be coded as CAMEO 0841 instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Example      | A group of Yoruba leaders announced yesterday that they are willing to forgive President Olusegun Obasanjo and queue behind him for a second term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Usage Notes  | Sign formal agreement Ratify, sign, finalize an agreement, treaty. This category excludes promises to sign or ratify agreements and treaties. Events should be coded under this category only when agreements are reportedly finalized or signed. This event code is typically reciprocal. Even when the agreement in question implies a formal commitment to boost material cooperation, provide aid, or yield in some way, the event of signing the agreement or treaty is still coded here since signing of an agreement or treaty represents diplomatic cooperation but does not guarantee implementation- whatever its terms. |
| Example      | Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov today signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation, the BTA reported. Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed. Czechoslovakia and China signed an agreement today to increase trade in 1983 by 50 percent compared with last year, the official Czechoslovak news agency Ceteka said today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Usage Notes  | Trade relations and other economic exchanges that are reciprocal in nature- event if the particular event in question cannot be coded as reciprocalseponduld be coded here. Unilateral and potentially altruistic provisions of economic aid should be coded as 071 instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Example      | European foreign direct investment flows in Latin America and the Caribbean rose more than eightfold during the second half of the 1990s compared with the first half of that decade, according to a study presented in Paris by the Inter-American Development Bank. Two 061 events are coded due to the compound target.                                                                                                                                                             |

| Usage Notes | Asylum is typically granted by states to persons in its territories (territorial asylum) and it constitutes a legal protection awarded to those persons against other states. Diplomatic asylum, protection typically accorded on the premises of an embassy, can also be granted and is similarly coded here. Not that 'Grant asylum' refers to a specific legal event type; informal provisions of shelter or opening of borders to masses of refugees should be coded as 'Provide humanitarian aid' (073) instead. |
| Example     | Peru has granted diplomatic asylum to five Panamanian army officers holed up in a diplomatic residence since last month's U.S. invasion, the Peruvian embassy said on Tuesday. Uganda has granted political asylum to 18 Zairean rebels who entered the country illegally two years ago and are wanted at home on treason charges, a United Nations official said on Friday.                                                                                                                                          |

| Usage Notes | Yield by instituting requested political changes. Note that this event type is different from 'Express intent to institute political reform' (034) as it involves the actual event of change-not just its promise. Just like military forms of yield, these could be voluntary concessions or involuntary surrenders. The Rwandan government on Thursday accepted demands from Hutu rebels that it initiate political reforms. |

| Usage Notes | Use this code when source surrenders power after being challenged through legitimate institutional channels (e.g. elections) or other coercive strategies (e.g. military coups). The target can either be the challenger(s) or the country as a whole.                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Usage Notes | Note the difference between policy and institutional change; the former can relate to any issue (economic, social, etc.) but it does not change the rules by which the political system functions. If another code within category 08 fits the policy in question more specifically, that code should take precedence (e.g. changing policy on economic sanctions should be coded as 085 instead). More often than not policies that fit under this particular code will be on domestic issues. As part of its fight to eradicate poverty, the governing Labour Party has introduced a legally-binding minimum rate of pay in Britain for the first time. |

| Description | Yield by undertaking major reforms that change how the political system functions. Changes from one type of a political system to another (e.g. from military dictatorship to multiparty democracy), as well as less comprehensive institutional changes that nevertheless modify the rules of the game (e.g. political party laws, electoral laws, powers and functions of different branches) are coded here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Example     | President Dos Sontas has reportedly conceded at last to demands from National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to overhaul the judiciary. Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril resigned yesterday to allow Haiti's first democratic elections to take place. The political change in this lead is more fundamental than leadership change given the mention of "first" democratic elections, which points to potential change in the overall political system (i.e. democratization).                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Description | Allow, receive inspectors in territories controlled by the source actor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Usage Notes | Code here reported deployment or arrival of inspectors; mere promises or agreements to accept their deployment should be coded as 0355 instead. The target for an 085 event should be the inspectors or the country/agency providing them. This event form is typically accompanied by code under category 09.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Example     | The IAEA has dispatched inspectors to Esfahan Uranium Conversion Facilities (UCF) in central Iran to monitor resumption of peaceful nuclear work at the plant. Two linked events (0862 and 090) are coded with actors reversed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Description | Allow access to, receive humanitarian agencies in territories controlled by the source actor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Usage Notes | Mere promises to allow such access should be coded as 0355. Note that this event form is accompanied by the linked event 'Provide humanitarian aid' ( 073 ) if the target is the humanitarian agency; in some cases the target would be the particular area that is given access.                                                                                                        |
| Example     | Humanitarian access for the Darfur region has improved significantly since September as the Khartoum government tried to secure international favor. Uzbekistan finally opened the Friendship Bridge after four years to allow the delivery of 1,000 tons of grain and flour to Afghanistan, where millions of people are at risk of starvation as winter sets in, reports aid agencies. |

| Usage Notes | Although mere declarations of ceasefire, or agreements to commence a ceasefire, do not guarantee that military engagement is actually halted, they are still coded here. The target could be the location for the ceasefire or the opponent.                                                                                                                                             |

| Name        | Retreat or surrender militarily                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Description | Retreat, withdraw, yield control of a location or territory by pulling out armed forces.                                                                                                                                       |
| Usage Notes | Note that the yielding should involve a comprehensive military disengagement, at least from a certain area of contention.                                                                                                      |
| Example     | Five hundred Ugandan rebels surrendered last week in the eastern town in Soroti followin a government offensive in the area, a local official said.                                                                            |
| Example     | The United States speeded up the withdrawal of some invasion forces from Panama on Wednesday, but defence officials cautioned that no deadline had been set for complete removal of the troops.                                |
| Example     | Bosnian Serbs said on Tuesday their forces had completed their withdrawal from the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde.                                                                                                           |

| NAME        | Inquire or search into human rights abuses such as rape, torture, targeted assassinations, and violations of basic freedoms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Usage Notes | Investigations of war crimes are coded as 094 instead. Alleged or potential perpetrators should be coded as targets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Example     | Members of the Association of African Jurists, a body linked to the Organi- zation of African Unity, investigated welfare of nearly 2,000 Libyans, some of whom have been held as long as seven years.                                                                                                                                                    |

| Description | Inquire or search into military activities such as violations of ceasefire, seizures, and invasions. If military actions in question involve potential human rights violations or war crimes specifically, code them as 092 or 094 instead. The perpetrator of the questionable military action should be coded as the target.                            |
| Example     | The Ceasefire Violations Committee (CFVC) has completed its investigation into an allegation by the Liberian Peace Council (LPC) that the NPFL had taken over the city of Greenville.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| NAME        | Inquire or investigate potential war crimes or look into allegations of war crimes. If the question surrounding a military action is not specified to be potential war crimes, 093 should be used instead. The perpetrator of the questionable military action should be coded as the target.                                                             |
| Example     | Serb civilians and prisoners and will bring suspects to trial, a Croatian official said. Serbian military police have launched an investigation into alleged crimes committed by Croat forces against ethnic Serb civilians and Montenegrin prisoners of war during the 1991-1995 Serbo-Croatian conflict, the newspaper Jutarnji list reported Thursday. |

| Usage Notes | This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 101-108 cannot be made. Note that demands are stronger or more forceful and potentially carry more serious repercussions-although not as much as threats-than simple appeals. We rely primarily on the language used by reporters to make this distinction. All demands are verbal acts.                               |
| Example     | Poland's parliament has demanded an immediate admission by Moscow that Soviet NKVD security forces murdered more than 15,000 captive Polish off-ficers during World War Two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Description  | Use this code for demands that target engages in or expands military relations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Usage Notes  | as through joint exercises or weapon sales. Demands for provision of military aid-not mutual exchange-are coded as 1032 instead.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Example      | The PRC on Tuesday demanded that the US cancel plans to sell air-tosurface anti-tank weapons to Taiwan to avoid "new damage" to US-PRC relations.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Example Note | While the requested policy does not directly involve material exchange between the source and the target, the former is clearly demanding cooperation on military issues.                                                                                                                                               |

| Usage Notes | Require, demand provision of humanitarian aid. Demands by refugees to be let into the territories of other countries (which should be coded as targets) and asylum demands all fit here. These are not necessarily verbal acts; refugees could be actively seeking shelter or refuge in target countries or regions. |
| Example     | Some 800,000 Iraqi Kurds sought refuge in Germany last month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Example      | Ethnic Albanians in south Serbia are demanding a U.N. military presence to protect them against a heavily armed ruling Serb minority and prevent a Bosnia-style civil war, but some foreign monitors are skeptical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Example      | The Red Cross operating in Iraq said US and British forces must ensure security to allow emergency water, food, and medical supplies to reach the needy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Description  | Require, demand political change not otherwise specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Usage Notes  | This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Source actors can be local citizens as well as international actors; they could be making the appeal on their own behalf or on behalf of others. Note that when the requested reform clearly constitutes some form of concession or yielding by the target, such as the easing of administrative sanctions, a more appropriate "Demand" code might be found under 105. |
| Example      | At the end of a seminar on reform, around 100 Arab intellectuals and activists published a declaration demanding wide-ranging political changes in the Arab world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Description  | Require, demand change in leadership or power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Usage Notes  | This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening appeals. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Note that even though demands for the target to resign or relinquish power are forms of yielding, they are still coded here. Also code demands for elections here (unless they are first-time elections and hence constitute major institutional change).                                                                                                              |
| Example      | Sunnis have demanded that control of the Interior Ministry be taken away from Shiite religious parties in the next government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Example      | Rwandan rebels demanded the removal of President Juvenal Habyariman and his ruling party at the fourth round of talks aimed at ending a 23-month civil war.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Example      | Former Socialist prime minister Andreas Papandreou demanded immediate elections after a special court cleared him of all charges in Greece's biggest corruption trial this century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Usage Notes | This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening demands. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Just like the source actor, the policy in question can also be domestic or international in nature. If it is clear from the lead that by demanding certain policy changes the source is in fact demanding that the target yield or concede, the event might be better coded under 105 (e.g. demands for military withdrawal should be coded as 1056). Opposition groups in Zimbabwe are demanding that President Mugabe abandon his controversial policy of land confiscations. |

| Usage Notes | This event form refers to verbal and non-threatening demands. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Institutional change is different from policy change in that the former directly alters the rules of the game. Demands for fundamental changes in the political system (e.g. democratization) as well as more limited institutional changes (e.g. changing electoral law) are coded here.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Usage Notes | This event form is typically, although not exclusively, a verbal act. The source for this event type may or may not be one of the adversaries; a third party could also be demanding that one or more of the parties in conflict (who are coded as targets) to yield. When a threat is attached to a demand for yielding, the appropriate code under category 13 should be used instead. Also, if accompanied by some form of protest activity, codes under category 14 should be used. When yielding actually takes place, use the appropriate code under category 08. The United States on Thursday demanded that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) forsake its nuclear program. |

| Usage Notes | Use this code when a government is pushed to undertake some political changes that clearly constitute some form of concession or yielding, such as relaxing or removing bans, curfews, or other restrictions that are already in place. Demands that take the form of demonstrations, protests, etc. are coded under category 14 instead. Human rights organization Amnesty International demanded that the Su- danese government end curbs on press freedom. The International Labor Office (ILO) reiterated its demand today that Israel ease restrictions on the movement of Palestinian workers.                                                                                              |

| Usage Notes  | Iran today threatened to launch a new military offensive in its Gulf war with Iraq unless Baghdad accepted its conditions for ending the 28-month- old conflict.                                                                                                                                     |
| Example      | Iran threatened to shell Iraqi towns today in retaliation for an air raid on the southern city of Susangerd where, it said, 100 people were killed.                                                                                                                                                  |

| NAME         | Threaten unconventional mass violence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Description  | Threaten to use force potentially affecting large masses of people, includ- ing the use of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear or chemical-biological- radiological attacks), mass expulsions or killings, as well as ethnic cleansing. This event form is typically a verbal act. Use this code for threats to carry out actions best represented in cue category 20. |
| Example      | A terror group based in Trinidad claims to be manufacturing chemical and biological weapons to use against the United States and Britain, according to a media report Sunday. Because of the compound target, two events are coded.                                                                                                                                     |
| EXAMPLE Note | Because of the compound target, two events are coded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| NAME         | Give ultimatum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Description  | Give a final warning, ultimate demand or order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Usage Notes  | This event form is typically a verbal act. Use it to code final demands, rejec- tion of which carries the risk of some form of retaliation by the party issuing the ultimatum. Use of this code depends primarily on the terminology used by reporters-look for the word 'ultimatum', otherwise, it is simply a threat.                                                 |
| Example      | Peru has issued an ultimatum to Ecuador to halt attacks across their dis- puted jungle border.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## 2.14 PROTEST

| NAME        | Engage in political dissent, not specified below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description | All civilian demonstrations and other collective actions carried out as protests against the target actor not otherwise specified. This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 141-145 cannot be made. Note that any form of civilian individual or collec- tive action that is undertaken as a symbol of support-rather than protest- for the target actor should be coded elsewhere (potentially under category 05). |
| Example     | The Homeland Union (Conservatives) began collecting signatures in part of a drive to convince the Lithuanian Parliament to amend the constitution so that same-sex marriages are banned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description | Dissent collectively, publicly show negative feelings or opinions; rally, gather to protest a policy, action, or actor(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Usage Notes | Use sub-categories if demands of protesters are known and codeable. The target for this event form is the party that the protest is directed against; the location of a demonstration sometimes represents the identity of the target. Up to 100 ethnic Albanians demonstrated on Tuesday in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where 24 people were killed in nationalist riots last March, Belgrade radio said.                                                      |
| Example     | March, Belgrade radio said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Usage Notes | Dissent collectively, gather, or rally demanding leadership change. Target should be the actor who is expected to relinquish power. Demonstrations that demand new elections should also be coded here. Angry activists from the defeated Fatah Party have staged rallies in the Gaza Strip against the party's leader Mahmoud Abbas, saying he must resign.                                                                                                         |

| Usage Notes | Dissent collectively, gather, or rally demanding policy change. Use this code when demonstrators demand specific policy changes or unspecified political reforms. Tens of thousands of university students throughout Indonesia staged mass demonstrations Saturday to demand political reforms by President Suharto's government.                                                                                                                                   |

| Description | Refuse to work or cooperate until demands for major institutional, constitutional, or regime change. Note the difference between institutional/constitutional changes and policy reforms. Strikes that call for independence or autonomy essentially demand major changes to the whole system and are hence coded here. |

| Description | Protest by blocking entry and/or exit into building or area, not otherwise specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Usage Notes | Use sub-categories if demands of protesters are known and codeable. Use this event form to code protest activities that seek to disrupt routine and normal proceedings by blocking roads, buildings, etc. When the blockade in question includes military forces, use 191 instead.                                      |
| Example     | Angry French paper workers blocked the Europe Bridge spanning the Rhine from France to West Germany for more than three hours by dumping saw- dust on the roadway, French border police said.                                                                                                                           |

| Description | Obstruct passage to demand change in institutions, regime                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Usage Notes | Note the difference between institutional/constitutional changes and policy reforms. Obstructions that call for independence or autonomy essentially demand major changes to the whole system and are hence coded here. Hundreds of thousands of people blocked streets in Hong Kong in defiance of Chinese authorities to demand democratic reforms. |

| Description | Use sub-categories if demands of protesters are known and codeable. Use this event form to code demonstrations and protests that turn violent. When the use of force to cause casualties is the primary purpose, use categories 18, 19, or 20 instead.                                                                                                |
| Example     | Palestinian prisoners rioted Monday at this jail in northern Israel, setting fire to their mattresses and smashing furniture, police sources said.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Description | Protest forcefully, in a potentially destructive manner, to demand leadership change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Usage Notes | Target should be the actor who is expected to relinquish power. Riots that demand new elections should also be coded here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Example     | Egyptian demonstrators rioted following a peaceful demonstration calling for the immediate removal of President Hosni Mubarak from office.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Description | Protest forcefully, in a potentially destructive manner, to demand policy reform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Usage Notes | Use this code when protesters demand specific policy changes or unspecified political reforms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Example     | Palestinian riots against Israeli military policies are still continuing with no end in sight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Example     | Note the difference between institutional/constitutional changes and policy reforms. Riots that call for independence or autonomy essentially demand major changes to the whole system and are hence coded here.

| Description | All military or police moves that fall short of the actual use of force, not otherwise specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Usage Notes | This category is different from cue categories 18, 19, and 20, as they refer to uses of force, while military posturing falls short of actual use of force and is typically a demonstration of military capabilities and readiness. Category 15 is also distinct from category 13 in that the latter refers merely to threats, is typically verbal, and does not involve any activity that is undertaken to demonstrate military power. Note that source actors for codes 150-153 are not necessarily militaries affiliated with states but any organized armed groups. Targets are actors against whom the source mobilizes its military capabilities in a threatening manner. |

Note that the termination can be either unilateral or bi/multi-lateral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Example     | Palestinians and Israelis failed to reach agreement on the fate of Palestinian offices in east Jerusalem Sunday, despite hours of tense negotiations, sources on both sides reported. Two reciprocal events are coded with actors reversed.                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Usage Notes | The source for this event form is typically the mediating party(ies). Use this event form to code failed mediation activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Example     | Syrian officers today ended mediation efforts between rival militias in Tripoli as shells continued crashing into the north Lebanese port and the death toll rose to more than 200.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Description | Terminate the presence of groups or organizations not otherwise specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Usage Notes | Use this category to code both expulsions by host authorities and withdrawals by guest groups or organizations. Note that expulsions or deportations of individuals-typically a legal matter-are coded as 174 instead. Mass expulsions of peoples are coded as 201. Withdrawal of hostile military forces constitutes a form of yielding and is thus coded as 0874. When diplomats are withdrawn or expelled, use 161. |

| Description | Terminate the deployment or presence of peacekeeping forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Usage Notes | Use this event form to code both expulsions of peacekeeping forces by host countries and voluntary withdrawals by actors providing the peacekeeping forces. Note that while the host country should be coded as the source actor when coding an expulsion of peacekeeping forces, the provider of the forces becomes the source when coding withdrawals.                                                               |
| Example     | Eighty UN peacekeepers were shipped out of the eastern Bosnian enclave of Gorazde Friday, leaving just 100 UN troops to follow them out later this month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Usage Notes | Use this event form to code both expulsions by host countries and withdrawals by providers of humanitarian aid. When aid is simply reduced or halted but the expulsion or withdrawal of the provider is not mentioned, use 1623 instead. |
| Example     | Jakarta forced the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, out of the country following the relief operation, although it had more than £12m of unspent donations.                                                                                     |

| Usage Notes | The distinction between 1822 and the default code 182 depend primarily on the particular terminology used by reporters. This code is used typically when "torture" is mentioned in the lead. Security forces in Guinea have tortured scores of Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees, whom authorities blame for a border conflict, Human Rights Watch (HWR) said Thursday. |

| Usage Notes | Killing individuals by physically assaulting them without the use of weaponry, through beating, torture, lynching, etc. When a physical assault-beating, torture, lynching, etc.-is specifically mentioned to have caused death, this code takes precedence over other codes for physical assault.                                                                         |
| Example     | A Palestinian prisoner died as a result of torture while in Israeli police custody, according to a report by a pathologist sent to Israel by Physicians for Human Rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Description | The use of explosive devices or improvised explosives outside of military engagements. This residual category is not coded except where distinctions among codes 1831-1834 cannot be made. Aerial bombings that involve the use of aircraft are coded as 195 instead.                                                                                                      |

| Usage Notes         | Attempt but fail to kill politically significant and influential persons. Use this code only when an assassination attempt or targeted killing is foiled; when assassinations are successfully carried out, 186 is used instead. This distinction is made because consequences of these two types of events could be significantly different. The source of this event would ideally be the assailant; however, in many cases this information will not be available and the location of the attack would be coded as the source instead. |
| Example             | An attempt to assassinate deputy governor of the Tyumen region, Oleg Chemezov, was thwarted in Khanty-Mansiysk (Siberia), the city's police reported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Usage Notes         | Use this event form to code targeted killings and assassinations of politically influential elites or leaders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Example             | Hezbollah guerrillas killed the deputy chief of Israel's militia ally in southern Lebanon Sunday sources on both sides said. This example is coded as an assassination because of the position the victim held (which is explicitly reported).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Description  | All uses of conventional force and acts of war typically by organized armed groups not otherwise specified. This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 191-196 cannot be made. In addition to unspecified acts of fighting, "killings" of any kind when the weapons used are not specified should also be coded here. When news leads refer to acts of killing that take place during an attack or some form of military engagement as "murders", those should still be coded here. However, murders in general-as criminal acts with no political connotations-are not coded under the CAMEO framework. The first example below illustrates how one can differentiate between these two different uses of the verb "murder". |
| Example      | One Serb policeman was murdered in an attack on a police patrol by Kosovo Albanians near the border with Kosovo, state agency Tanjug reported Sunday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Description | Attack, bomb from air, not specified below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Usage Notes | Use this event form to code bombings that involve the use of military aircraft. When both aerial and other small types of weapons are used, this code takes precedence. This residual category is not coded except where distinctions among codes 1951-1952 cannot be made.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Example     | Soviet aircraft including helicopter gunships killed 46 Afghan civilians in an attack on a village in the western province of Heart. Israeli helicopters and tanks shelled positions of the Palestinian security forces and residential areas near the town of Rafah.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Name        | Employ precision-guided aerial munitions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Description | The use of aerial weapons that utilize internal and/or remote sensing and guidance controls to strike specific targets. The distinction between 1951 and the default 195 depends on whether the particular terminology used by reporters is indicative of guided or precision weapons. The weapons themselves must have guidance capability and should be differentiated from "surgical aerial attacks" which are otherwise coded under the default 195. |
| Example     | British aircraft using precision guided missiles killed 4 Iraqis in an attack on a suspected weapons supply in Basra.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Description | The use of remotely piloted or unmanned aerial platforms for the delivery or ordinance.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Usage Notes | Use this event form to code aerial attacks that involve the use of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles. This code takes precedence over the use of precision guided munitions (1951).                                                                                    |
| Example     | Recent US Predator attacks, occurring about once every three days, have killed at least eight top al-Qaeda leaders since last July, according to Pentagon sources.                                                                                                         |
| NAME        | Violate ceasefire                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Usage Notes | Reinitiate fighting in the midst of a formal or informal ceasefire or truce.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Example     | Both the Phillippines military and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front are guilty of violating the ceasefire agreement signed in March 2001, according to a group that conducted simultaneous fact-finding missions in Lanao, Maguindanao, and Cotabato provinces last week. |
| NAME        | Two reciprocal events of the same type are coded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## 2.20 ENGAGE IN UNCONVENTIONAL MASS VIOLENCE

| NAME        | Use massive unconventional force, not specified below                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description | All uses of unconventional force that are meant to cause mass destruction, casualties, and suffering not otherwise specified. This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among codes 201-204 cannot be made.                                                                     |
| NAME        | Engage in mass expulsion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Description | Force large groups of people or populations out of some territory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Usage Notes | Note that this event form is different from expulsions of diplomats and international or non-governmental groups (166), and legal deportations (174). Mass expulsions coded here are typically carried out with the intention of clearing out a particular group of people out of a specific area. |
| Example     | The Israeli army forced out on Wednesday more than 1,000 Palestinian refugees from their homes in a West Bank refugee camp during a 48-hour search for militants, residents said.                                                                                                                  |

| NAME        | Engage in mass killings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description | Kill a substantial number of people, typically with the intention of ridding a territory of a particular group of people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Usage Notes | Politically motivated mass killings and genocides are coded here, relying primarily on the specific terminology used by reporters to identify an event that involves "mass" killings.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Example     | Sudan's government is responsible for mass killings and other atrocities in the Darfur region, according to a United Nations report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| NAME        | Engage in ethnic cleansing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Description | Use mass expulsions and/or mass killings targeting a specific ethnic group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Usage Notes | When a report identifies mass expulsions or mass killings as being motivated by ethnic cleansing, use this code instead. The only way we can code ethnic cleansings as such is only if reporters use that particular terminology; therefore, we will need to rely on careful analysis of our event data, whereby we would focus on particular dyads, to reliably measure ethnic cleansings. |
