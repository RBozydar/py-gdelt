| Description | All public statements expressed verbally or in action not otherwise specified. This residual category is not coded except when distinctions among 011 to 017 cannot be made. Note that statements are typically subordinate events; events such as comments are coded as mere statements only when they do not further imply appeals, agreements, support, apologies, demands, disapprovals, rejections, threats, etc. |
| Example     | U.S. military chief General Colin Powell said on Wednesday NATO would need to remain strong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Usage Notes | This event form is a verbal act. The target could be who the source actor declines to make a comment to or about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Example     | NATO on Monday declined to comment on an estimate that Yugoslav army and special police troops in Kosovo were losing 90 to 100 dead per day in NATO air strikes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Usage Notes | This event form is a verbal act. Only statements with explicit pessimistic components should be coded as 012; otherwise, default to 010.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Example     | Former West Germany Chancellor Willy Brandt said in a radio interview broadcast today he was skeptical over Moscow's will to agree on limiting European-based nuclear weapons.

| Example     | Turkish President Turgut Ozal said on Wednesday he was confident that the United States would remove irritants damaging relations between the two NATO allies.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Example     | A Damascus-based Palestinian guerrilla group claimed responsibility on Saturday for attacks on Israeli troops from Jordan in the past two days.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
