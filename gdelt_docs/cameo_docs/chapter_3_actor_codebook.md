## Chapter 3

## ACTOR CODEBOOK

Actor and agent dictionaries are developed to systematically assign codes to names (of individuals, countries, identity groups, organizations, etc.) that refer to source or target actors in news reports. Several regional dictionaries have been developed within the framework of the CAMEO project. In addition to laying out the format and the rules that apply commonly to the creation of new codes in actor and agent dictionaries, this codebook documents the shared and region-specific actors that existed in the dictionaries at the time of this codebooks compilation (as well as some updates from subsequent revisions). It does not contain an exhaustive list of all agent and actor codes utilized in the various KEDS/CASCADE projects that make use of the CAMEO coding schemes. Coders who modify CAMEO or add new codes (not names, but general types) should record the changes made.

As projects have demanded more specificity from CAMEO codes, the complexity and length of CAMEO codes have increased. Early CAMEO codes may be simpler than strict adherence to the rules below would imply.

## 3.1 HIERARCHICAL RULES OF CODING
Actor codes are composed of a series of three-letter groups, written in the order pictured above. The length of the code given to any actor depends on the number of these groups applicable to an actor and necessary for the needs of the coding group, but TABARI currently limits the total number of characters to fifteen, i.e. five three-letter codes. Some actors may be deemed important enough to warrant a three character code unique to themselves, but most just use a combination of specific and generic codes.

Coding of any actor follows two basic rules:

- 1. Proceed from the general to the specific.
- 2. Maintain a consistent pattern (ideally the one above) in choosing the hierarchical placement of appropriate three letter classifications.

No actor will use all the categories listed, but rules and hierarchy provide the coder with a clearer path of how an actor's coding scheme should break down and ensures some level of consistency

across studies.

## 3.1.1 Domestic or International?

There are two types of actor in the CAMEO coding scheme: domestic and international. How an actor is coded depends on which of those types the actor is.

For a domestic actor, the first three characters of the CAMEO code indicate the actor's country. The United Nations list of standard three-letter country codes is used to identify countries. The current list, as well as a list of changed and added codes, can be found at the UN website (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm). A list of UN country codes is also presented in Chater ?? .

Actors that cannot readily accept a single national identifier may instead take an international code. Different generic codes are used to differentiate between various kinds of international and transnational actors. IGO (international governmental organization), IMG (international militarized group), NGO (non-governmental organization), NGM (non-governmental movement), and MNC (multinational corporation) are the main generic codes. They can either be used on their own or as the first three characters of more detailed codes. A few special cases-religious groups, ethnicities, and international regions-are handled as international actors but do not begin with international codes.

In addition, we have the code UIS (unidentified state actor), which is used when an actor is known to be a country or government-or it is known to act on behalf of a country or state-but the identity of the particular country is not revealed in the report (e.g. "foreign diplomat"). Similarly, if an international actor cannot be categorized for whatever reason, INT can be used as the last-resort, catch-all code. UIS and INT are typically used as three-letter codes on their own.

The following subsections describe how a domestic actor is coded, in order from left to right in the code. The differences for international codes are described in subsection 3.1.9.

## 3.1.2 Domestic Region

In countries with federal systems, autonomous regions, other forms of decentralization, or any other idiosyncratic facts that render regional distinctions politically significant, our codes link actors to sub-state regions as well as countries. Assigning actors domestic region codes (as the second three characters) allows researchers to code and study intrastate events which might have domestic as well as international significance. Sub-state codes are often essential components of a regional dictionary-the Balkans is one such case. Serbia during 2003-2006, for example, is assigned the code [SCGSRB] , where SCG is the UN code for the state of Serbia and Montenegro and SRB denotes the Republic of Serbia, which was a sub-state entity within Serbia and Montenegro.

In some cases, we have assigned geographic regions within a country their own three character codes because the distinction was important for demographic or other political reasons, even though these regions did not have legal status. For Turkey, we have given Southeast Turkey its own code ( [TURSOE] ), which has allowed us to capture many domestic events (particularly between Kurdish insurgents and the Turkish state) that we otherwise could not. A comprehensive list of all sub-state region codes can be found in the respective region-specific sections of this codebook.

## 3.1.3 Primary Role Code

Generic role codes are assigned to actors in order to indicate their roles and statuses, when known and relevant, within their respective countries. They are appended to the initial country and

regional codes.

A comprehensive list of generic role codes can be found in Table 3.1. We make a crucial distinction between primary, secondary, and tertiary role codes. Coders should use primary codes to identify the role of a domestic actor wherever reasonable; among those, GOV , MIL , OPP , and INS or SEP (formerly REB ) are in fact the most commonly used.

REB has been, for most of CAMEO's history, the catch-all term for violent opposition groups. SEP and INS were added in late 2009, and they have more or less replaced that code for specific actors. However, REB still is used to code cases where a violent opposition group's aims are unclear, or where the group has very plainly limited goals (i.e. not involving separating from overthrowing the government). Also, older projects using CAMEO use only the REB code, and, depending on the project, coders may choose not to use SEP or INS . Coders should be sure, however, to distinguish between these kinds of actors and those assigned a secondary role code of CRM (see subsection 3.1.6). While CRM actors may utilize violent operations, they primarily exist for the purpose of achieving monetary profit or other self-gratification and not for the achievement of political aims through violent efforts.

UAF should be used as a last resort when an armed group cannot be identified either as MIL or REB . This situation tends to arise when the association of a given armed group with the state it operates in is unclear (e.g. whether it is an independent rebel group or a paramilitary), or the group is accepted but not controlled by the state. If the link between a paramilitary and a state is common knowledge, however, MIL should still be used-even though the group might not officially be part of the state military institution. The Serb Volunteer Guard, also known as Arkan's Tigers, for instance, should be coded as [SRBMIL] .

Note that actor codes with domestic roles will often need date restrictions to reflect changing roles of actors through the span of the dataset. This is especially true when coding countries that experience frequent power changes. Section 3.2.1 details how such restrictions are added.

## 3.1.4 Party or Speciality (Primary Role Code)

The PTY (party) distinction is a special role code that comes after primary role codes but before anything else. Political organizations receive the designation PTY when they field candidates for local or national elections, they are considered legal/legitimate by the current political regime, and they are not, at an organizational level, armed or violent. Individuals receive the designation PTY if they are members of qualified political organizations but are not members of the national or local executive. The PTY designation, whenever possible, comes immediately after OPP or GOV . Whether a party is in opposition or government depends solely on whether it is a member of the executive at the highest level of government for which it fields candidates.

Alternatively, a second primary role code can be appended to the first to represent an actor's area of power or concern. This happens, for example, with secretaries and ministers of defence; though they are part of the government, they exercise control over military affairs and are thus coded [XXXGOVMIL] . This case is discussed in more detail in section 3.2.5.

## 3.1.5 Ethnicity and Religion

In the latest version of the system, we have a detailed, global classification system for both religious and ethnic groups: these are discussed in Chapters 10.0.4 and ?? . These have not, however, been systematically incorporated into all of the dictionaries.

## 3.1.6 Secondary Role Code (and/or Territory)

If none of the primary codes applies to the actor in question, coders should choose from secondary role codes. Hence, for instance, a labor union would have the LAB code and a given journalist would have the MED code only if they cannot be identified as OPP . However, this restriction does not preclude the addition of secondary role codes to the primary code if such distinctions would be valuable to the coders. An opposition labor union, for example, would code as XXXOPPLAB .

Although we have a code for the legislative branch ( LEG ), it is identified as a secondary code and used sparingly. When a given legislative body is mentioned as an organization (e.g. the parliament, the House of Commons, the Senate), LEG is always used. When a particular political party or individual member of the legislature is in question, however, the convention has been to use GOVPTY or OPPPTY , depending on whether the relevant party has control of the executive branch . If the coders are more interested in the differentiation between the executive and legislative branches of a government or if control of the executive is separate from control of the legislature it may be more useful to code these actors as LEG .

Outside of religious applications, tertiary role codes should be used only as last resort. RAD captures ambiguous identifiers such as "radical," "extremist," and "fundamentalist" which can be encountered in news reports but do not refer to any systematically identifiable group or role. We felt compelled to create the code to systematize the the coding of such ambiguous labels, the meaning of which could vary from reporter to reporter and across regions: Does the term "extremist" refer simply to the conservative nature of a group or does it imply that the group in question is armed and violent? In order to avoid bias and to ensure reliability, RAD (and not REB ) should be used in such cases. For example, "extremist Serbian nationalist" should be coded as [SERRAD] . Similarly, MOD should be used when ambiguous identifiers such as "moderate" and "mainstream" are encountered.

## 3.1.7 Specialty (Secondary Role Code)

Secondary role codes can also be included in a CAMEO code to indicate an actor's specialty (much like in subsection 3.1.4. They can be added not only to primary role codes, but also to ethnicities, religions, or even other secondary role codes. For example, a legislative committee concerned with education would be coded as [ XXXLEGEDU] , while a Muslim student dissident would be [ XXXOPPMOSEDU] .

Tertiary role codes are used in this position as additional modifiers to facilitate the grouping of specific types of actors if one's analysis requires such a distinction, for example applying the designation of RAD to specific actors associated with known fringe or extremist groups. However, use of these codes should be driven by necessity, either because of the specificity required for the analysis or because of limitations in the source texts.

## 3.1.8 Organization Code

In cases where the coder wants to and can-given the amount of information available in the news lead-distinguish between different actors of the same generic domestic role, different groups can each be given their own three-character codes, which are then be used as the last three-characters. For example, the Likud and Meretz Parties in Israel are assigned the nine character codes of [ ISRGOVLKD] or [ ISROPPLKD] and [ ISRGOVMRZ] or [ ISROPPMRZ] , respectively. 1

Organization codes, especially for IGOs and NGOs, restart the cycle of role codes. Hence, a subunit of the specially coded actor may receive a code for its specialty. For example, the High Commission for Refugees is a suborganization within the United Nations, which has a special actor code (IGOUNO). The High Commission's code is simply added onto the U.N.'s code, becoming IGOUNOREFHCR: " REF " for refugee, " HCR " as its own special actor code.

## 3.1.9 International Codes

International codes apply to all actors who identify with more than one state. Most international actors' codes begin with a generic international code.

Table 3.2 defines the major international codes, along with examples. Notice that some of these examples are simply assigned the three character generic codes, while others are further specified with both generic and specific codes.

The distinction between NGO and NGM is meant to capture the theoretical difference between well-structured, formal non-governmental organizations and anomic or non-associational social movements. Although the line dividing the two is often fuzzy, we believe that the distinction is theoretically important-perhaps more so for some research questions than others. Greenpeace, for instance, is one of those difficult cases: although it is typically thought to be an NGO, it actually functions more as a loose and informal movement with some more formal organizations, such as the Greenpeace Foundation and Greenpeace USA, associated with it.

The IMG code is intended to identify those non-governmental groups, organizations, and movements on the international or regional level for whom militarized operations are their primary means of interacting within the international system. The distinction between an IMG and a domestic rebel group can be subtle. We define a militarized group to be international only if both its goals and its activities are substantially international.

$^{1}$Note that both of these codes need to be date-restricted appropriately since their roles as ‘government’ versus ‘opposition’ change regularly. Also, the project using these codes predated the introduction of the PTY code; were they coded now, they would be [ ISRGOVPTYLKD] , [ ISROPPTYLKD] , and so-on.

Sometimes news articles refer to unnamed actors such as "human rights advocates," "antiWTO protesters," and "supporters of Palestine". Such actors are best coded as NGM since they clearly belong to some non-governmental collective effort but, at the same time, are not explicitly associated with specific organizations. "Aid workers," on the other hand, are coded as NGOs, since participation in aid distribution generally requires an organization-even if the identity of the group is not specified in the news lead.

Some international actors do not always need a generic international codenamely, transnational regions, ethnicities, and religions. Moreover, the ordering and use of codes is slightly different for international actors than for domestic actors. We list these differences below.

Location Sometimes news reports do not specify a group of countries separately and instead refer to them using the general geographical region they are associated with, such as Latin America ( LAM ), the Middle East ( MEA ), Eastern Europe ( EEU ), etc. In such cases, where exact identification of the countries involved is not possible, international region codes laid out in Table 3.3 can be used as the first three characters, which then typically constitutes the entire code.

In some cases, actors are primarily transnational/international in nature, yet their country affiliations are also known. Coders can include both pieces of information by attaching country codes to the generic transnational/international codes. This could be particularly valuable if, given the research agenda, the country distinction becomes key at the analysis stage. (For example, actors with codes NGOUSA , NGMUSA , and MNCUSA can all be combined with other USA actors at that stage, while still preserving the full codes/information in the dictionaries for alternative groupings.) (See sections 2D and 2E.) Attaching the country code does not indicate that the actor is officially identified with or that he acts on behalf of that state. The same technique can be used when only a regional affiliation is known-NATO's code, for example, includes " WST " to indicate that it is a Western organization.

Ethnic and Religious Codes Some ethnic or religious identity groups are not strictly associated with single countries, thereby requiring their own three character codes. These codes are assigned as the first three character codes when not explicitly linked to a specific location or country. Even groups connected to a country may not be domestic actors. Albanians are significant not only in the state of Albania but in other Balkan countries as well; therefore, when news reports specifically mention ethnic Albanians and not the state of Albania, we distinguish between the two by assigning the code ABN as opposed to ALB, which corresponds to Albania.

However, some international organizations have distinct ethnic or religious identities-especially IMG's-in which case, an identity code can be used in conjunction with a generic international code and any number of other codes. Hence, Al Qaeda is coded as [IMGMOSALQ] .

Role Code (Any) International organizations can be coded to show their composition, purpose, or area of expertise. For instance, a multinational media corporation would code as [MNCMED] , with perhaps the interjection of the country where it is headquartered. Coders may use more than one role code, if they feel they must-only be sure to maintain the order of primary before secondary before tertiary.

Organization Code Some international/transnational actors get their own special three charac -ter codes (e.g. UNO for the United Nations, AMN for Amnesty International, IRC for the Red Cross), but these are used only as suffixes to these generic actor codes and any other specifying codes (i.e. [IGOUNO] , [NGOHRIAMN] , [NGOHLHIRC] ). Table 3.4 lists such actors who are currently assigned their own special codes in our regional dictionaries; both regionally and globally relevant actors are listed, but note that this list need not be final and coders/researchers can give other actors their own codes.

As an exception, we also have a six-character generic code used for peacekeeping forces when the particular organizational affiliation is not known: IGOPKO . This code is assigned even when the national identity of the peacekeepers in question is specified. Hence, for instance, "Senegalese peacekeepers" are coded as IGOPKO since they operate as part of an inter-governmental organization and they might be representing the United Nations or ECOWAS.

Second Specialty and Suborganization Code Often, an important IGO or NGO, worthy of its own organization code, is actually part of another important actor (usually the United Nations). When this situation arises, the overarching organization is coded first, and the specialty of the suborganization (if there is one) is added on the end, followed by its specific code. For example, the High Commission for Refugees is a suborganization within the United Nations, which has a special actor code (IGOUNO). The High Commission's code is simply added onto the U.N.'s code, becoming IGOUNOREFHCR: " REF " for refugee, " HCR " as its own special actor code. Be sure to avoid accidentally breaking the "primary before secondary" rule-the suborganization's specialty cannot be a primary role code if the organization's specialty is a secondary role code.

Third Specialty A third specialty code can occasionally be used when the spokesperson for an organization is identified (coded MED ).

## 3.2 OTHER RULES AND FORMATS

## 3.2.1 Date R estrictions

Many actor codes require date-restrictions to limit the period for which TABARI will assign that code to the actor. The format of these codes do not deviate from the framework laid out below except for the inclusion of specific dates, which indicate the periods that correspond to each of the different codes. The need for date restrictions arise when the dataset covers a long period and the roles of individuals/groups/organizations-even the names and structures of states-change during this span.

Political power frequently changes hands in Israel. Hence, we cannot give the Israeli Labor Party, for example, a single code that specifies its domestic role. Instead, we code it as daterestricted, capturing when the party was part of the administration and when it played the role of opposition. 2

ISRAELI LABOR PARTY [ISROGLV LBA

This entry indicates that the Labor Party acted as part of the Israeli government for all of the specified periods and as the opposition during all other times. Furthermore, due to its prominent role in Israeli politics, the party is given its special three-character code ( LBA ), which sets it apart from other opposition groups or coalition partners in case the researcher wishes to make that distinction at the analysis stage.

Even states sometimes need to be date-restricted when previously sovereign states (or parts of other states) merge (e.g., East and West Germany, North and South Yemen, and North and South Vietnam) or existing states breakup to create multiple new ones (e.g. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Ethiopia/Eritrea). For instance, Serbia has the code

SERBIA [YUGSRB

which indicates that Serbia was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia up until it gained its independence in 1992, after which it formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (with Montenegro), which became the new state-a looser federation-of Serbia and Montenegro after February, 2003. On 5 June 2006, the union of Serbia and Montenegro was dissolved and they each became separate sovereign states.

For a more comprehensive explanation of date-restrictions, readers should refer to Chapter 5 of the TABARI manual (available at http://eventdata.psu.edu/software.dir/tabari.html).

## 3.2.2 Actors and Agents

TABARI makes use of two different types of dictionary in order to appropriately code sources and targets of event data. Actor dictionaries came first, containing singular pattern-matchable entries with specific actor codes. Each actor had to be given its own entry into the appropriate actor dictionary. In early 2009, this process was augmented by the creation and addition of agent dictionaries. Rather than list specific actors explicitly, the agent dictionaries use commonly recurring words to categorize actors and help alleviate the need for redundancy in the actor dictionaries. For example, the word "admiral" indicates that an actor should be classified MIL . Once ADMIRAL is added to the agents dictionary, TABARI will automatically add the code MIL to the end of the actor's code in

$^{2}$Recall that the project in which Israel was coded preceded the addition of the PTY code.

the output file when admiral is found near the actor's name. (This is subject to being overridden by specific entries in the actor dictionaries. For example, the entry ADMIRAL NELSON would be read before the agent, allowing him to be identified as a historical figure, rather than a military actor.)

Actor entries take precedence over agent entries, as the actor codings are presumed to be more specific. Where the agent and actor codings would result in duplication of classifications, the duplicate is ignored. Therefore, if ANTRIM is in the actor dictionary coding as [USAMIL] and ADMIRAL is in the agent dictionary (coding as [~MIL] ), then TABARI on seeing the actor "Admiral Antrim" will code the resulting as [USAMIL] and not [USAMILMIL] . TABARI does not combine agent codings. Hence, for example, while both " STUDENT " (coding as [~EDU] ) and " DISSIDENT " (coding as [~OPP] ) may be present in agent dictionaries, TABARI will not read "student dissident" as [~EDUOPP] . Instead, STUDENT DISSIDENT must be explicitly entered into the agent dictionary. This was done to avoid situations in which "student dissident" and "dissident student" would code differently ( EDUOPP and OPPEDU respectively). Implementation of a hierarchical system for combining multiple agents into a single actor coding may be part of future implementations of TABARI as a further effort to cut down on the need for seemingly redundant dictionary entries.

## 3.2.3 Dictionaries

Currently the agent dictionaries are comprised of separate dictionaries for the GOV , MIL , OPP , and REB codes as well as a generic agent dictionary that handles references for secondary and tertiary role codes. As indicated previously there are also two agent dictionaries for the correct capture of religious codings (differentiated by their level of specificity). Additional helpful dictionaries to the coder are the NGO actor, the Elite actor, and the IMG dictionaries.

The elite actor dictionary has entries for a number of prominent organizations or individuals that would code with the ELI designation. Unfortunately most of the entries are specific to the US making it of limited value to those coding other regions. The IMG dictionary is a work in progress capturing actors that would be associated with several groups that fall under the IMG classification. In some cases only the name of the organization and known other appellations are listed but for some prominent members or leaders are also listed and provided with appropriate codes. For example "Osama bin Laden" is captured by this dictionary and assigned the appropriate IMG MOSALQ coding.

The NGO actor dictionary covers a wide variety of NGOs that a coder might want to capture. Rather than assign specific three character codes for every NGO/IGO efforts have been made to capture these actors with the appropriate International/Transnational actor code followed by a state or geographic region code (indicating either home country of the actor or primary region of its activities) and role codes (usually secondary) that indicate its primary area of expertise. Ethnic or religious identifications have also been captured where they were deemed appropriate.

## 3.2.4 Automatically-coded Celebrities

TABARI will code elites automatically in certain sentences. One will note that within the secondary role codes the code ELI specifically mentions former government officials. This is implemented within TABARI by recognizing that the word "former" as part of an agent or actor coding will cause the recognized pattern to be discarded in favor of the ELI secondary role code. Hence, "former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan" will code as USAELI instead of USAGOV . Should TABARI fail at deleting double-codes, a Grep filter of the results can do the same task.

## 3.2.5 Coding Conventions

A number of examples have already been provided in the above sections but it seems worthwhile to point out a few additional as well as examples of coding conventions that can be utilized so as to standardize actor coding across coders.

One such convention is used to distinguish between various members of the US Department of Defense. Most actors in the Defense Department should be coded with the designation MIL followed by either SPY (if connected to military intelligence) or GOV if they are service specific or below (the Commandant of the Marine Corp or Secretary of the Navy for instance). All DoD personnel above this level that are responsible for policy setting code as GOVMIL as they are primarily associated with the government but their role within the government is military oriented.
