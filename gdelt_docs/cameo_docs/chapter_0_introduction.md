The CAMEO event coding ontology has been developed over a period of more than a decade and has benefitted from substantial contributions by a number of people. At the risk of missing some people, the major contributors have been:

Initial development of verb and actor ontology (2000-2003): Deborah J. Gerner, O'mur Yilmaz, Philip A. Schrodt

Refinements of actor ontology (2004-2007): Dennis Hermrick, Baris Kesgin, Peter Picucci, Joseph Pull, Almas Sayed, Sarah Stacey

Organized Religion (2009-2011): Matthias Heilke

Ethnic Groups (2011): Jay Yonamine, Benjamin Bagozzi

Funding for CAMEO has been provided by the National Science Foundation (SES-0096086, SES0455158, SES-0527564, SES-1004414)

## Preface: About This Manual
In the early days of the web, one would frequently encounter pages highlighted with the phrase "Under Construction" along with some icon, at varying levels of cleverness, invoking roadwork, . These have become less frequent since as the norms of the Web evolved, and the community came to collectively recognize that almost every web site is always "Under construction."

As is this manual. The CAMEO system has been a work-in-progress since it began in 2000, and this manual has been an effort to track and codify those efforts, but is now, and always has been, a working document that has been primarily intended to be used internally at the event data projects first at Kansas, and then at Penn State. Nonetheless, it has information that other people have found useful, and given that one of the first things that seems to get lost in coding projects is the manual, making an imperfect manual available seemed to be the better course of action than waiting to write the perfect manual.

Over the years, we have tried to make it more systematic, and in fact parts have gone through extensive re-writes. But other parts-notably a number of the region-specific codes-weren't really finished (or, to an extent, have been superseded) but still contained information we weren't ready to throw out. The original event coding scheme, and the newer religious and ethnic classification schemes are quite systematic; the actor scheme is very uneven, and we are still working on a separate section on agents.

It is what is it.
