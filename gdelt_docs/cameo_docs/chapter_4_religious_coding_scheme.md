## CAMEO Religious Coding Scheme

## 4.1 Introduction

CAMEORCS provides a greater level of detail for coding religion than the shorter CAMEO format by systematically assigning alphanumeric codes to individual religious groups and generalized religious terms. It was created during the summer of 2010 as a part of a larger, CAMEO-based project, and is thus intended as an optional supplement to CAMEO codes. The longer codes are used in actor codes in the exact same place and manner as the simple religious codes. Further, at every level of coding, CAMEORCS grandfathers in the religious codes used by CAMEO's shorter format.

The CAMEORCS directory includes a relatively comprehensive list of religious groups. However, projects may require adding more-and more specific-codes. Adding and coding new religious groups follows the same two rules from actor coding and adds two more.

- GLYPH Proceed from the general to the specific.
- GLYPH Maintain the hierarchical ordering prescribed by the manual.
- GLYPH As far as it is possible, code religious groups by their defining and distinguishing characteristics.
- GLYPH The manual describes which codes to prioritize; follow its prioritization.

CAMEORCS is restricted to three spaces (i.e. nine letters), so coders must be picky about which codes they use.

## 4.1.1 Self-Identification

CAMEORCS is not intended to be a grand theological treatise on who's who in the spiritual world. Coding must balance how a group regards itself and how it is regarded by others-especially its coreligionists. In the same vein, this scheme gives groups religious codes whenever plausible. Many organizations today have been called religious but do not regard themselves in this way. These groups nonetheless receive religious codes. Codeable groups include any organizations, communities, and fraternities based around a common philosophy, faith, or ethic. However, do not code religious groups that are dead during the time period of study.

## 4.1.2 Individualism

Each religious group, down to the lowest plausible level, is given its own distinct code. In addition, some relevant generic terms, e.g. "conservative Anglican", receive their own codes. However, the coder must choose the level of detail to which he or she codes-coding individual congregations would not be plausible. Consistency is not needed; for example, the original directory includes individual Catholic monastic orders, but only denominations (or even associations of national denominations) within Protestantism. In short, include everything worth coding.

## 4.1.3 Hierarchies

Often, groups would apparently take different code than the category above them. For example, non-trinitarian Christians are generally coded as CHRMAY , but a few trinitarian congregations nonetheless have constituent groups that are not. In this type of case, coherency may overrule accuracy; when a subgroup is accepted by its group, code it with that group.

## 4.2 First trio of letters

The first three letters of a religious code identify a specific religion or family of religions. Every religion that claims five million adherents or more receives its own code, as designated by prior coding (see Table 4.1.) Offshoots of a religion are given the code of their parent religion, unless they themselves have an individual code (e.g. Christianity, Sikhism, etc.)

Smaller religions are not given their own three-letter codes. Instead, they are categorized within families of religions. We use the common division annotated in the list below. A given religion may have strong influences from more than one of these families, in which case the coder must choose the best fit. Of the families of religions, new religious movements ( NRM ) hold a special place. They describe religious or philosophical movements, communities and companies created in the last century-and-a-half. The NRM code has lowest priority. For example, the code for a new Indian religious movement would begin with INR , not NRM .

|                 | Indigenous tribal religions | ITR    |
| Third Priority  | new religious movements     | NRM    |

## 4.3 Second trio of letters

The second trio of letters divides the first category further.

## 4.3.1 Denominations

First, if the first trio is a a named religion, the second trio can indicate a significant denomination or movement of that religion, e.g. Protestantism from Christianity, Shiism from Islam, or Zen from Buddhism. A complete collection of these codes can be found in the CAMEORCS directory.

## 4.3.2 Generic terms

Alternatively, the second trio can be a generic religious code. Such codes, listed in Table 4.2, simply serve to divide the first groupings into more manageable chunks, and generally apply across religions and family groups. These generic codes are ranked in priority in the table.

MAY , OFF , and NRM serve special roles within named religions, and we define them closely to handle delicate religious issues. MAY is used when a religious group considers itself a part of the parent religion, but the parent religious at least in large part rejects its inclusion. OFF applies to religious groups who do not consider themselves a part of the religion from which they are derived. (Whether the parent religion agrees is disregarded.) New religious movements ( NRM ) refer to movements that are widely regarded as being within the religion but outside any named sudivision, and were created in roughly the last century-and-a-half. Within religious families, NRMs have the same meaning as they would if used as the first three letters (see Section 4.2).

## 4.3.3 Generic, or Denominational?

Since CAMEORCS is designed to code actors, generic terms can sometimes override named denominations. Unitarian-Universalism, for example, comes from the Protestant tradition but does not self-identify as Christian-hence, it is only sensible to code it as CHROFF . The same phenomenon can occur with any generic codes that might describe heterodoxy, but it always occurs with OFF .

## 4.3.4 Region

For all indigenous tribal religions ( ITR ), the second set of letters should be a transnational region, taken from the listings in [the CAMEO actors manual]. Hence, indigenous tribal religions are organized by their geographic origins. This system will inevitably result in the occasional odd code, like [USAITSEA##] ( USA for United States and SEA for Southeast Asia), thanks to immigration.

## 4.3.5 Nothing

Finally, when there are no applicable specific or generic codes, the second trio can simply be left blank. Ecumenical organizations will usually skip secondary codes, as will general groupings like "conservative [religion]".

|                 | Group/Religion              | Code   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| First Priority  | offshoot                    | OFF    |
| Second Priority | named denominations         |        |

| Fourth Priority | controversial status        | MAY    |
| Fifth Priority  | new religious movements     | NRM    |

## 4.4 Third trio of characters

[CAMEORC] codes are completed by a number between 001 and 999. Once again, some codes will skip this trio, namely general categories ("Protestant" as opposed to "Lutheran"). The earliest numbers in a set (001-009 or 001-099) are reserved for generic terms, e.g. "conservative" or "evangelical" or "moderate", etc. The header of categories can describe both the group described and the mainstream of that group. For example, [CHRLDS000] refers to both any unknown group or person within the Latter Day Saints movement and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (e.g. mainstream Mormons, as opposed to splinter groups.)

After the generic terms, the numerical codes can be manipulated to form subcategories. For

example, we divide Judaism in the tens column: Liberal Judaism is [JEW050] , Neolog Judaism is [JEW060] , Orthodox Judaism is [JEW070] , and so-on. Subsets of Liberal Judaism would be [JEW051] , [JEW052] , [JEW053] , etc. New Japanese Religions (which come from Shinto) are divided in the hundreds column, into Sect Shinto [SHNNRM100-200] and Shinshukyo [SHNNRM300-400] . Sect Shinto is then subdivided in the tens column, because it has relatively few subgroups, whereas Shinshukyo is divided in the singles column.

Initially, the religious directory has been arranged in alphabetical order (within subsets). However, when adding to the directory, add to the end of whatever category is desired. Creating an alphabetized directory of codes is a matter of a few minutes in Excel, whereas reconciling earlier work to a newly-numbered version of the coding scheme is much trickier. Thus, do not change the order of entries.

Giving an organization its own numerical code ameliorates the effect of coding mistakes and subjectivity. To use a silly hypothetical, suppose the dictionary writer were to mistakenly code Scientology as a form of Orthodox Christianity. In practice, so long as the codes are not combined in the analytical level, Scientology will be [CHRDOX###] (remember, this is a hypothetical!) and generic Orthodoxy will be [CHRDOX000] -so the two can be distinguished, and someone looking at the behaviour of the actors will see that the two are distinct (and potentially catch the miscode.) When in doubt, add a number!

## 4.5 Religion-specific coding issues

Religions tend to be as comparable as apples and oranges. As such, different religions are divided slightly differently, we list the major differences below.

## 4.5.1 Christianity

A coder must exercise considerable restraint in adding religious groups to the directory of Christianity - as a both institutionally fractious and very large religion, the number of identifiable Christian groups and denominations vastly outnumber the spaces available for coding. The MAY code sees extensive use in Christianity. We place groups in this category if they follow a non-trinitarian doctrine, worship their leaders, or add new scriptures to the Biblical canon.

## 4.5.2 Hinduism

Hinduism is rarely treated by scholars as a single religion, but instead as a group of related religions. Simultaneously, it may be plausibly divided by two methods: by denomination/deity or by philosophy. Hence, instead of denominations, Hinduism's named subcategories are purely taxonomical: HINAST for its Astika ("orthodox") schools, and HINDEN for its denominations. The hundreds place within these sectarian indicate which denomination or school is coded. Most Hindu organizations will be alphabetized within their denomination or philosophy, rather than placed under another level of hierarchy-the requisite information for coding often is absent.

## 4.5.3 Judaism

Judaism can best be divided into its movements. However, we also provide a section for the quasie ethnic distinctions of Ashkenazi, Sephardic, etc. The former categorization always takes priority.

## 4.5.4 Shintoism

Shintoism was especially profoundly affected by the worldwide religious shift that started in the mid-nineteenth century, with hundreds of new religious movements being birthed since then. The standing of these organizations in regard to Shinto is not always well-defined. Rather than dividing these "Japanese new religions" into NRM , MAY , and OFF , we categorize them all as "NRM".
