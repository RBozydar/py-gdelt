## Chapter 10

## Regional Dictionaries

At various points in the Keds project we developed dictionaries focused on specific geographical regions. We currently have three main regional dictionaries-the Middle East, the Balkans, and West Africa. We have also developed a unique, separate dictionary for Turkey. In addition to following the same format and rules, these dictionaries also have a chunk of entries-actors and corresponding codes-in common. Most countries and major international actors, for instance, are found in all of the dictionaries. They differ from each other only in that each contains additional entries that are relevant only for the issues and the countries in that particular region; the difference occurs because we develop separate dictionaries-verbs and actors-for each region using leads relevant for that region. However, because the creation of dictionaries is systematic and consistent process, the regional dictionaries can be compared and merged at any time to build comprehensive main dictionaries. (We do merge our dictionaries periodically; hence, the initial dictionaries we use in our regional dictionary developments were at one time created from the merging of a number of smaller and more regional dictionaries.) The following sub-sections describe and list the special actor codes-those that have special suffixes attached to make them more specific than the generic codes, as well as the special group identity codes-that are found in respective dictionaries.

A major difference that sets the actors dictionary for Turkey apart from our other actor dictionaries is its incorporation of idiosyncratic codes-typically dealing with generic agents who are assumed to be Turkish (see Table 10.4)-that make the dictionary unsuitable for use in coding other countries. Its merging with other dictionaries would therefore require the elimination of certain entries. See the sub-section on Turkey for more details.

Note that the actual dictionaries are much longer than what are listed in this codebook; what is listed here are the codes that one encounters in our dictionaries or in the output at the analysis stage, and not all the entries that correspond to each code. In many cases, domestic actors are also simply assigned generic codes (such as country or identity code plus the domestic role code) when they are entered in the dictionaries. It is only when one wants to make a distinction between different actors with the same generic code-for instance, between two or more coalition partners in a government-that special codes are created. It is important to continually update this codebook and include new special codes, if any are created; otherwise, the analysis stage would be complicated since what the different codes refer to will not have been documented (except in the dictionary itself).

## 10.0.4 Ethnicity and Religion

In the regional dictionaries, some identity groups are specifically identified as residing in particular countries, generally explicitly (e.g. "Canadian Tamils" or "Christians in Baghdad"). In such cases,

religious/ethnic identity codes are added to the country codes (e.g. HRVSER for ethnic Serbs living in Croatia).

These identity codes can in some cases also be composed of six letters, instead of three. For example, the code for the Druze is MOSDRZ , and when an actor is specifically known to be a Lebanese Druze, then the code becomes LBNMOSDRZ . In instances where the actor is known to be religious in nature (such as a reference to priest, monk, abbot, etc.) but the religious affiliation is not identified the Generic Religious ( REL ) code should be used. Lists of such identity codes exist in Tables 10.1 and 10.2.

The original religious codes were adapted from HURIDOCS but are very general and give uneven levels of specificity. We eventually intend to replace this with the far more detailed religious group classification in CAMEORCS (Chapter but the older system will be found in many of the regional dictionaries.

By convention, ethnicity always precedes religion in a CAMEO code.

## 10.0.5 The Middle East

The Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, has been our primary focus in coding the Middle East. Hence, our dictionary is most developed with respect to domestic political actors in Israel and Palestine. As part of a separate project, we have also extensively coded Algeria, and the actors dictionary from that project has been merged with our Levant dictionary. We started coding Turkey using this more general Middle East dictionary. Due to the presence of idiosyncratic codes, we have not merged the actors dictionary we developed for Turkey back into this dictionary; this could still be done, however, selectively.

Table 10.3 shows a list of the actors with special codes in the Middle East dictionary. Note that because of the dynamic nature of the domestic positions of many of these actors (for instance, an opposition party yesterday but a government coalition party today), many are date-restricted, so that the domestic generic codes that specify their positions can vary depending on the date of each news report. 'd.r.' refers to 'date-restricted'; for the exact dates refer to the dictionary itself.

While the code PSE (UN code) refers to the Occupied Palestinian Territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, PAL refers to Palestinians as an identity group. Therefore, Palestinian government and other state actors are coded as PSEGOV , PSECOP , etc. depending on their respective roles. The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), however, is coded as PALPLO as it represents the Palestinian people in general; because of its unusual status, the PLO could not be assigned one of the generic domestic role codes. The organizations underneath the PLO are each assigned codes based on their spheres of influence. Hence, Yasser Arafat and Fatah are date restricted as PALPLO before the Oslo Accords of 1993-which marked the establishment of the Palestinian Authority-and as PSEGOV thereafter. (Fatah itself is in fact further specified as PSEGOVFTA .)

## 10.0.6 Turkey

As mentioned above, CAMEO's actor dictionary for Turkey is unique in that it includes idiosyncratic codes which require that it not be used without certain modifications when coding other countries. The reason is that it gives vaguely identified actors codes that identify them as actors associated specifically with Turkey (even if the information is not explicit in the new leads). For example, "rebels" who are not further specified are coded as TURREB and "soldiers" similarly unspecified are coded as TURMIL. We were able to do that since Turkey was the only country included in that project and it was the only country listed in our search string for news leads; we could reasonably assume that the insufficiently specified actors we come across would in most cases be associated with Turkey.

Table 10.4 shows a list of these unique codes which are present only in our special actors dictionary for Turkey. Note that because TABARI gives precedence to longer patterns over less specified, shorter entries, when news leads further specify the identity of these actors and they are entered into the dictionary as such, these idiosyncratic codes are trumped. For example, "Kurdish rebels" are coded as KURREB and "Iraqi police" is coded as IRQCOP.

In the context of Turkey, "village guards" refer to Kurdish locals in Southeast Turkey recruited by the military to fight Kurdish guerrillas, mainly the rebels associated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)-coded TURREBPKK. Hence, although they are not officially associated with the Turkish state and the Turkish military, village guards are coded as TURMIL; this is how we would code stateponsored paramilitaries.

We also deviate from the normal CAMEO protocol in coding what are called "State Security Courts" (Devlet Guvenlik Mahkemeleri, DGMs) in Turkey. Until June 1999, these courts included military judges and were commonly regarded as being controlled by the Turkish Armed Forces. Therefore, although court systems are typically coded as JUD (or TURJUD in case of Turkey), we code "State Security Courts" as TURMIL for dates prior to 990618. These courts were finally abolished in May 2004.

Unlike Table 10.4, Table 10.5 presents a list of special actor codes which could be integrated into other dictionaries. Again, note that what is listed here are the codes that one encounters in the dictionary or in the output at the analysis stage, and not all the entries that correspond to each code. The key for coding Turkey is to get the date-restrictions right; with the exception of post-2003, the multi-party period in Turkey has been marked by short-lived coalition governments and frequent elections. Furthermore, the banning of political parties and their rebirths with slightly changed names have been commonplace in Turkey, thereby requiring date-restrictions to null-code closed parties.

Also, while Turkey is a unitary state and there was little legal basis for giving geographic regions or cities their own special codes, it proved essential to introduce certain regions and cities as different actors in order to facilitate the coding of domestic contentious politics events.

Table 10.4: Ambiguous Actors and Idiosyncratic Codes for Turkey

$^{1}$DEHAP and HADEP are in fact different political parties, both representing the Kurdish opposition in Turkey. DEHAP, which later joined DTP in 2005, is seen as the continuation of HADEP, which was banned in 2003.

## 10.0.7 West Africa

In addition to coding West Africa in general with CAMEO, we also coded Liberia and Nigeria for separate projects. Therefore, the West Africa dictionary is most developed for these two countries. Also, because of the level of political decentralization and the importance of intra-state ethnic interactions in these countries, numerous special region codes have been developed particularly to represent the federal states within Nigeria and the counties of Liberia. The domestic region codes for Nigeria are listed in Table 10.6 and those for Liberia are listed in Table 10.7. Note that some of these regions, such as the Niger Delta region in Nigeria, do not constitute legal boundaries but still represent politically important divisions within their respective countries.

Other region-specific special codes are listed in Table 10.8. Ethnic groups are coded as six character codes if the exact location of the actors is not specified: the Ogoni people of Nigeria, for example, are coded as NGAOGO as long as the news report does not associate the actor with a more specific region within the country, but as NGAABUGO if the specific actor in question is identified as being from Abuja. The same applies to other ethnic groups and other regions. Note that most of the political and militant groups and organizations in this region are not being assigned special codes; this is not because they are not important enough to warrant special codes, but because the first six characters are typically the codes for the country and the region/the ethnic group ( NGAHAU , NGAAGU , LBROGO , etc.), and the last three characters are then generally used to specify the roles of the actors. For example, the O'odua Peoples Congress (a Yoruba rebel group) in Nigeria is assigned the code NGAYRBREB -Nigeria, Yoruba, rebel group-which is not a special code (i.e., any Yoruba rebel group would be assigned the same code). Also, note that only a few of the special political organization codes are date-restricted; this reflects the current state of the dictionary, but this could, and should, change as coding continues and the roles of these actors change.

## 10.0.8 The Balkans

Our focus in coding the Balkans has primarily been on the conflict and conflict resolution events during the first half of 1990s. The Balkans actors dictionary is, therefore, most developed with respect to ethnic and territorial divisions (as opposed to specific political parties or organizations).

## The Former Yugoslavia

The state of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia disintegrated by 1992 with the breaking away of its constituents republics, eventually forming the states of Slovenia (UN code SVN ), Croatia (HRV ), the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia (MKD ), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH ), and Serbia and Montenegro (SCG ).

Bosnia and Herzegovina, created with the Dayton Agreement of 14 December 1995 which brought three years of civil war to an end, has a federal structure that consists of two republics: the Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIHBHF ) and the Bosnian Serb Republics Srpska (BIHSRP ). Generic role codes (such as GOV , MIL , OPP , etc.) for actors associated with BIHBHF and BIHSRP become the last three characters of the actor codes. In order to differentiate between the states/republics and the people as ethnic groups, Bosnian Muslims are coded as BIHMOS (not BIHBHF ), Bosnian Croats as BIHCRO , and Bosnian Serbs as BIHSER (not BIHSRP ). More generally, CRO and SER refer to Croat and Serb ethnic groups. If an actor with a given ethnicity is associated with either one of the federal units specifically, the ethnicity code can be attached to the six-character unit code (e.g. BIHBHFSER ). Generic role codes (such as GOV , MIL , OPP , REB ) can also be used as the last three-character.

After the fellow constituent republics of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina declared independence in 1991, Serbia and Montenegro-the remaining federal states of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia-formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (then UN code FRY ). On February 4, 2003, however, a new constitution was accepted, abdicating this self-proclaimed successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and replacing it with a loose federation called Serbia and Montenegro (UN code, hence the CAMEO code, becomes SCG ). The new federation consisted of the two states of Serbia (SCGSRB ) and Montenegro (SCGMTN ), as well as the two autonomous provinces of Kosovo (SCGSKV ) and Vojvodina (SCGVVD ). With Montenegro's unilater declaration of independence on 3 June 2006, followed by Serbia's declaration on 5 June 2006, SCG also ceased to exist and gave way to two independent states: MTN and SRB (with SRBKSV and SRBVVD as autonomous provinces).

Note that the state of Serbia has a code that is different from that of the ethnic group of Serbs, who might or might not be living in Serbia. When an actor is associated with the ethnic group of Serbs and its country of origin is not specified, the actor is assigned the code SER ; if the Serb in question is associated with a certain location such as Bosnia-Bosnian Serb-then the code becomes BIHSER (not BIHSRB or BIHSCG ). The same rule applies to the other ethnic groups.

A more comprehensive list of major actor groups in the region and their respective codes can be found in Table 10.9. Note that actors with generic codes are not listed; the point here is to document the different codes-not to list all actor entries, which would mean replicating the whole dictionary-that exist in the dictionaries so that codes which show up in the output can be easily identified during analysis. Actors listed in the last group are derivations of different ethnic groups living in different countries. This list is not exhaustive; those listed here are meant as examples of how state/country codes and codes for ethnic groups living in those countries are merged to create special group codes.
